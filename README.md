# Introduction.
Hi, these are my notes and thoughts from working on the third project for Metis data science bootcamp. The data that I use is here (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019). If you update the first couple of file paths to your locally downloaded version of the data you should be able to run through it with few issues.

Let me know if it doesn't work!

I worked on this to get a better sense of classification models, namely random forest.
